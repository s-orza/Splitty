# OOPP Template Project

This repository contains the template for the OOPP project. Please extend this README.md with instructions on how to run your project.

For adding a tag:
In the add/edit page you can add tags with a name and a color. After you click the "+" button,
the tag will appear in the list. You can edit tags in the page with statistic.
**You cannot delete** the tag with the name **"other"** or to change its name, but you can change its color.

For keyboard shortcuts:
All functions are accessable with keyboard shortcuts. You move around all pages with left, right, up and down, and can even use tab. If
you click enter it fires the function.
