# OOPP Template Project

This repository contains the template for the OOPP project. Please extend this README.md with instructions on how to run your project.

For adding a tag:
In the add/edit page you can add tags with a name and a color. After you click the "+" button,
the tag will appear in the list. You can edit tags in the page with statistic.
**You cannot delete** the tag with the name **"other"** or to change its name, but you can change its color.
