# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 

> Really good agenda, it follows the template and all points are clear and well described. 

> For the task timestamps, I would also give an estimate to subtasks as well so you can coordinate the meeting easier.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback:

> Good notes, especially in the "Miss Elena" part :). However, they do not really contain any concrete agreements/task assignments, which is a very important thing to write down.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback:

> You really took time to ensure all topics are covered with the amount of depth, as well as urge the team to discuss about splitting the tasks when you were running out of time. Great performance overall.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: 

> Great meeting as always:) You were all active, enthusiastic, and took ownership of the meeting.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback:

> The progress is good, however I expected an almost finished product in terms of basic features considering you aim for at least a 9. So you should put in some more work in the following weeks.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: 

> You seem to distribute tasks equally, which is great. Also, I'm glad you included a discussion about last week's work in the agenda.
