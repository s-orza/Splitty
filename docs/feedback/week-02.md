# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: 
> The agenda was added before the meeting, which is good. I can really see the effort that was put into it and I appreciate it:). As a tip, please try to stick to the 45min timeframe next time and also include some time at the beginning for TA announcements.

> You follow the old template (the one from Gitlab) instead of the new one presented in the assignment. For this week that's okay, but starting next week please use the updated (and shorter by the way) agenda template. 

> The individual points in the agenda were clear. I liked that you included a schedule of the future assignment deadlines.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 

> The chair ensured all topics are followed thoroughly and with an appropiate depth. I really appreciated the enthusiasm for presenting the topics.

> However, one important issue that should be understood by everyone in the team is that the chair does not **present**, he **guides**. So, as a chair, you don't need to explain the curriculum, do the planning by yourself, etc., you only need to propose the topics and make sure everything is covered up. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: 

> You took ownership of the meeting as a team, which is great. The overall athmosphere was constructive and you seem to be eager to help each other out. I liked that by the end of the meeting, everybody shared their ideas and was involved in the discussion.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 

> I would have expected more progress last week in terms of the application, such as discussing the backlog, making some sort of planning, maybe some wireframes/database schema etc. 

> This week, it is **mandatory** that everyone starts coding, so please discuss the backlog as soon as possible, split up some initial tasks and work on something:). 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good

Feedback: 

> It's a bit early to tell, but you all seem involved in the project. 

> However, considering that you didn't really have any progress as a team in the past week apart from some individual work on the Git Assignment (no Code of Conduct work, no backlog discussion), the overall contribution of the team is a bit low.
