<h3> Notes </h3>

-----------------------------Tasks to do------------------------------

Buddycheck should be done until Friday and it is anonymous. Everybody 
reviews everybode else. Critizism should be constructive!

------------------------Planning and Organizing-----------------------

We have to create a branch from the issue directly. (Created from the 
big blue button). We have to use milestones from this point forward. 
Sublabels are pretty important and useful for organisation. 
Issue templates are a thing apparently, that is useful in creating issues.
Time tracking is important as well. We can do estimated and real time spent.
It is a better idea to work at the same time on front and back end. That's full stack.
We have to work in week 5 as well, because it will be added to week 6 knockout criteria. 

--------------------------RECAP ON LAST WEEK-------------------------- 

Everybody is satisfied with the amount of amazing work we did last week. 
In intellij we can see the entity relationship of the database, but we 
need a plugin for that.

--------------------------------Miss Elena---------------------------------

Miss Elena is really happy with our amazing work on the database, api and 
the front end connectivity. We know we are her favourite group!

----------------------------Things to check---------------------------

Raw SQL may not be really allowed. But we have to check.
