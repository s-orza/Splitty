planning:
- VERY IMPORTANT: start using the "Time tracking" feature on gitlab for issues and after time spent
- Everyone should work on 2 issues per week so smaller issues
- Add more information to description of issue
- To template of issue add definition of done, for explicit acceptance criteria
- Clearer titles for issues and merges

Code Contributions and Code Reviews:
- VERY IMPORTANT: we only have 4 checkstyle rules and should have 10+, maybe if at end time we can consider(5 min)
- When we comment on someone's mr we dont point out what he should change before we fix it
- The amount of discussion doesnt correlate to what we are uploading
- For more important contrevirsal changes having 3 reviewers might be prefered
- Modify the pipeline structure and include a separate "checkstyle" stage instead of having it integrated into the test stage so we dont need to push to see it failed form checkstyle (guide given)
